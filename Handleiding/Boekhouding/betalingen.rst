In Odoo, payments can either be automatically linked to an invoice or bill or be stand-alone records for use at a later date:

If a payment is linked to an invoice or bill, it reduces/settles the amount due of the invoice. You can have multiple payments related to the same invoice.

If a payment is not linked to an invoice or bill, the customer has an outstanding credit with your company, or your company has an outstanding debit with a vendor. You can use those outstanding amounts to reduce/settle unpaid invoices/bills.
Registering payment from an invoice or bill
When clicking Register payment in a customer invoice or vendor bill, it generates a new journal entry and changes the amount due according to the payment amount. The counterpart is reflected in an outstanding receipts or payments account. At this point, the customer invoice or vendor bill is marked as In payment. Then, when the outstanding account is reconciled with a bank statement line, the invoice or vendor bill changes to the Paid status.

The information icon near the payment line displays more information about the payment. You can access additional information, such as the related journal, by clicking View.
