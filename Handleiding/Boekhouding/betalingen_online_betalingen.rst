Online payments
----
To make it more convenient for your customers to pay the invoices you issue, you can activate the Invoice Online Payment feature, which adds a Pay Now button on their Customer Portal. This allows your customers to see their invoices online and pay directly with their favorite payment method, making the payment process much easier.
