.. h:div:: intro-list

.. rst-class:: intro-balance

The \**Balance Sheet*\* is a snapshot of the company's finances at a
specific date (as opposed to

the Profit and Loss, which is an analysis over a period).

\* .. rst-class:: intro-assets

\**Assets*\* represent the company's wealth and the goods it owns. Fixed
assets include buildings

and offices, while current assets include bank accounts and cash. The
money owed by a client is

an asset. An employee is not an asset.

\* .. rst-class:: intro-liabilities

\**Liabilities*\* are obligations from past events that the company will
have to pay in the

future (utility bills, debts, unpaid suppliers). Liabilities could also
be defined as a source

of financing which is provided to the company, also called \*leverage*.

\* .. rst-class:: intro-equity

\**Equity*\* is the amount of the funds contributed by the owners of the
company (founders or

shareholders) plus previously retained earnings (or losses). Each year,
net profits (or losses)

may be reported as retained earnings or distributed to the shareholders
(as a dividend).

What is owned (an asset) has been financed through debts to reimburse
(liabilities) or equity (profits, capital).

*A difference is made between *\ **assets**\ * and *\ **expenses**\ *:*

-  An **asset** is a resource with economic value that an individual,
      corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that
      it will provide a future benefit. Assets are reported on a
      company's balance sheet. They are bought or created to increase a
      firm's value or benefit its operations.

-  An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to generate
      revenues.

   #. **Chart of accounts**

The **chart of accounts** lists all the company's accounts: both Balance
sheet accounts and P&L accounts. Every transaction is recorded by
debiting and crediting multiple accounts in a journal entry. In a way, a
chart of accounts is like a company's DNA!

Every account listed in the chart of accounts belongs to a specific
category. In Odoo, each account has a unique code and belongs to one of
these categories:

-  **Equity and subordinated debts**

   -  **Equity** is the amount of money invested by a company's
      shareholders to finance the company's activities.

   -  **Subordinated debts** are the amount of money lent by a third
      party to a company to finance its activities. In the event of the
      dissolution of a company, these third parties are reimbursed
      before the shareholders.

-  **Fixed assets** are tangible (i.e., physical) items or properties
   that a company purchases and uses to produce its goods and services.
   Fixed assets are long-term assets. This means the assets have a
   useful life of more than one year. They also include properties,
   plants, and equipments (also known as "PP&E") and are recorded on the
   balance sheet with that classification.

-  **Current assets and liabilities**

   -  The **current assets** account is a balance sheet line item listed
      under the Assets section, which accounts for all company-owned
      assets that can be converted to cash within one year. Current
      assets include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, stock
      inventory, marketable securities, prepaid liabilities, and other
      liquid assets.

   -  **Current liabilities** are a company's short-term financial
      obligations due within one year. An example of a current liability
      is money owed to suppliers in the form of accounts payable.

-  **Bank and cash accounts**

   -  A **bank account** is a financial account maintained by a bank or
      other financial institution in which the financial transactions
      between the bank and a customer are recorded.

   -  A **cash account**, or cash book, may refer to a ledger in which
      all cash transactions are recorded. The cash account includes both
      the cash receipts and the cash payment journals.

-  **Expenses and income**

   -  An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to
      generate revenues. It is simply defined as the cost one is
      required to spend on obtaining something. Common expenses include
      supplier payments, employee wages, factory leases, and equipment
      depreciation.

   -  The term "**income**" generally refers to the amount of money,
      property, and other transfers of value received over a set period
      of time in exchange for services or products.
